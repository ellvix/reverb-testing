# Procedural Reverb Synth (Web Audio API)

This is a browser-based tone generator built using the Web Audio API. It generates a pure sine wave oscillator and simulates reverb using a procedurally created impulse response â€” no external audio files needed.

## Features

- Adjustable oscillator frequency (pitch)
- Customizable tone duration
- Procedural reverb with user-defined duration and decay
- Dry/Wet mix controls for balancing clean vs reverb trail
- Play and Stop buttons to interact in real-time

## Controls

- **Oscillator Frequency**: Sets the pitch of the tone in Hz
- **Tone Duration**: How long the tone plays before stopping
- **Reverb Duration**: Length of the reverb impulse buffer (affects how big the space sounds)
- **Reverb Decay**: How quickly the reverb fades away
- **Dry Gain**: Volume of the clean, direct sound
- **Wet Gain**: Volume of the reverb (echo) tail

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern browser and click **Play** to hear the sound based on your selected settings.  
Click **Stop** to immediately kill all audio output.

> Note: Some browsers (like FF and mobile) require a user interaction (like a click) to allow audio playback.
